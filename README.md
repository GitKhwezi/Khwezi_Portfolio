# [Project 1: Data Science Salary Estimator: Project Overview](https://github.com/GitKhwezi/Khwezi_Portfolio/blob/master/Khwezi_Masinga_SalaryPredictor.R)
In this project I created a data mining objective to select candidates for a new service offered by a sponsor targeting individuals whose salaries exceed R50 000. I scraped, cleaned and transformed over 191000 records from csv file using R programming. 
This could be useful for companies that want to identify a certain demographic of customers to target promotions to them. I was able to get the model to predict the individuals salaries exceeding R50 000 to a 94% accuracy after performing a validation test.
